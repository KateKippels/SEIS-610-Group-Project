Our program will take a set of data and fit an equation to it. We will do this using an evolutionary computing process. Individual equations are expressed as trees and tested with respect to testing data. After testing a new generation of trees will be created and tested again. Equations which fit well are more likely to survive to the next generation. They are also more likely to cross-over part of themselves with another equation or to mutate one of their values. Once testing reaches a defined termination condition it will return the function which best fits the data. Each generation will also produce some evaluation metrics to watch the progress of the program.
